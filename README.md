# I'm looking for a React coach

Hi, I'm Gregor. I want to learn React for both work and Open Source projects. I realized I need help with that and would like to hire someone I can pair with on a regular basis. Interested?

## Who I'm looking for

- Pairing on Open Source with full attribution
- Hours: 20-40h per month
- Hourly rate: $30-60
- Pairing on 3-5 workdays during 2-4pm US Pacific time (apologies for the lack of more flexibility on my side)
- Technologies: Mostly [React](https://react.dev/) and [Primer](https://primer.style/design/), but also Octokit, Next.js, and other technologies needed for our projects
- Minimum 3 months
- Fully Remote
- I strongly encourage you to apply if you are from a marginalized group in Open Source

## What we will pair on

- Project Forms: https://github.com/project-forms/project-forms.github.io/issues/1
- octokit-primer libraries and components
- Other GitHub related Open Source projects that combine Octokit with Primer - we can decide together what that could be

## The process

1.  Finding candidates: applications by October 15th
2.  Interviews (20-30min) with up to 10 candidates (I will donate $40 to your US-based non-profit organization of choice as a thank you)
3.  Exercise with up to 5 candidates: 1 paid pairing sessions for 2h
4.  Trial with up to 3 candidates: 1 week, fully paid
5.  Contract

## About me

Hi, I'm Gregor. I'm an Open Source maintainer for 10+ years. I currently (co-)maintain [@octokit](https://github.com/octokit), [@probot](https://github.com/probot), [@octoherd](https://github.com/octoherd), [@all-contributors](https://github.com/all-contributors), [@semanti-crelease](https://github.com/semanti-crelease), [@nock](https://github.com/nock), and several smaller projects.

After creating GitHub's official JavaScript SDK, I always wanted to create a set of components that are built on Primer (GitHub's Design System) that would enable integrators to build custom UIs for GitHub Apps with as little effort as possible. But neither I nor the Primer team had the time to explore this idea.

More recently, my work focus shifted to React as well. I want to take the opportunity to learn React while working on Open Source, with the help of someone who knows React well and is interested in working on Open Source.
