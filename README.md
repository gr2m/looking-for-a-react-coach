# I'm looking to hire a React coach

Hi, I'm Gregor. I want to learn React for both work and Open Source projects. I would like to hire someone I can pair with on a regular basis to help me learn better.

## Who I'm looking for

- Pairing on Open Source with full attribution
- Hours: 20-40h per month, for a minimum of 3 months
- Hourly rate: $30-60
- Pairing on 3-5 work days during 2-4pm US Pacific time (apologies for the lack of flexibility on my side)
- Well versed in modern React
- Fully Remote
- I strongly encourage you to apply if you are from a marginalized group in Open Source

## What we will pair on

- Technologies: React and [Primer](https://primer.style/react/), but also [Octokit](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.js), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), and other technologies needed for our projects
- Project Forms: https://github.com/project-forms/project-forms.github.io/issues/1
- octokit-primer libraries and components
- Other GitHub related Open Source projects that combine Octokit with Primer - we can decide together what that could be

## The process

1.  Finding candidates: applications by October 30th
2.  Interviews (20-30 min) with up to 10 candidates (as a thank you I will donate $40 to your US-based non-profit organization of choice)
3.  Exercise with up to 5 candidates: 1 paid 2h pairing session per candidate
4.  Trial with up to 3 candidates: 1 week, paid
5.  Contract

## About me

Hi, I am Gregor. I have been an Open Source maintainer for 10+ years. I currently (co-)maintain [@octokit](https://github.com/octokit), [@probot](https://github.com/probot), [@octoherd](https://github.com/octoherd), [@all-contributors](https://github.com/all-contributors), [@semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release), [@nock](https://github.com/nock), and several smaller projects.

After creating GitHub's official JavaScript SDK, I wanted to create a set of components that are built on Primer (GitHub's Design System). The goal was to enable integrators to build custom UIs for GitHub Apps with as little effort as possible. But neither I nor the Primer team had the time to explore this idea.

More recently, my work focus has shifted to React again. I now want to take the opportunity to learn React more thoroughly while working on Open Source, with the help of someone who knows React well and is interested in Open Source.
